// scoring system
if lose, no points
if win
  max score in a game = 1000 points (player completes game within 1 click and 5s)
  starting from 5s, points get deducted from 1000
  but points will be deducted before 5s if player clicks more than 1 click
  final score = prev score + (1000 - (time * clicks) / 4)
  player will not get any points if((time * clicks) / 4 > 1000)

  **note 1 click counts as .25, hence the final score divides clicks / 4
